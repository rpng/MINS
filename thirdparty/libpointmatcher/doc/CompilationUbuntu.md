__Note:__ we only support 64-bit systems because of some issues with Eigen. Other versions will most probably work but you'll have to try yourself to know for sure.

The rest of this tutorial will guide you through the different requirements step by step.

## Detailed Installation Instructions

### Some Basic Requirements 

#### a. Installing Boost

[Boost](https://www.boost.org/) is a widely-used C++ library and is included in most Linux distributions.  You can quickly check if Boost is installed on your system by running

```bash
ldconfig -p | grep libboost
```

If you see a list of results then you can skip to the next section.  If not, you most likely have to install Boost.

Instructions for downloading and installing boost to Unix systems can be found [here](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html).  Boost can also be installed as a package by running

```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

#### b. Installing Git

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a version control system similar to SVN designed for collaboration on large code projects.  Because libpointmatcher is hosted on Github, you should the git application to keep track of code revisions, and bug fixes pushed to the public repository.

Git should already be installed on your system but you can check if it is by running

```bash
git --version 
```

If Git is installed, you should see a message of the form

```text
git version 2.17.1
```

If not refer to the Git homepage for installation instructions or install via the package manager by running

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

#### c. Installing CMake

[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) is a cross-platform build system and is used for building the libpointmatcher library.  Refer to the homepage for installation instructions, or you can once again use the package manager

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-gui
```

*NOTE:* CMake has a GUI called cmake-gui which can be useful for configuring builds.  We recommend you install this as well since it will be referred to in this tutorial.

*NOTE 2:* Some functionalities like find_package() (only useful if you intent to link with your own project) will only work if you have CMake 2.8.11 or over. On Ubuntu 12.04, only 2.8.7 is available using apt-get. If you intent to use such functionality, you will have to compile CMake from sources.

### 1. Installing Eigen

The Eigen linear algebra library is required before installing libpointmatcher and can be found [here](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/).  Either download and compile Eigen following instructions from the package website or simply install package via apt by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
```

### 2. Installing yaml-cpp

The yaml-cpp library can be installed via apt by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev
```

### 3. Installing libnabo

libnabo is a library for performing fast nearest-neighbor searches in low-dimensional spaces.  It can be found [here](https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/libnabo).  Clone the source repository into a local directory of your choice.

```bash
mkdir ~/Libraries/
cd ~/Libraries
git clone git://github.com/norlab-ulaval/libnabo.git
cd libnabo
```

Now you can compile and install libnabo by entering the following commands

```bash
SRC_DIR=$PWD
BUILD_DIR=${SRC_DIR}/build
mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR} && cd ${BUILD_DIR}
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ${SRC_DIR}
make
```

This will compile libnabo into a `/build` directory.

To make sure that everything is working properly, you can run the unit tests:

```bash
make test
```

This will run multiple nearest-neighbor searches performances and may take some minutes.

Then, install the library on your system by running the following command :

```bash
sudo make install
```

*Note:* If Eigen or Boost are not in their regular system locations you will have to indicate their location by setting the corresponding CMake flags. Go [here](#possible-caveats) to see how it can be achieve.

<!---
### 3. Installing yaml-cpp 0.3.0 (Optional)
Configuration files can be managed using YAML in libpointmatcher.  This allows users to edit configuration files in a readable format.  To support this, you need to install [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp).  **It is important that you install the older version (0.3.0) of lib-yaml or you will not be able to install Pointmatcher.**  If you are using versions of Ubuntu newer than 12.04, see the warning below. Either compile and install from the source or install package by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp0.3-dev
```

#### Warning for users of Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) or more recent versions
The yaml-cpp package for Trusty Tahr provides yaml-cpp0.5. Libpointmatcher is so far only compatible with yaml-cpp0.3 and thus an older version of yaml-cpp should be installed manually.
-->

### 4. Installing libpointmatcher

First, you need to clone the source repository into a local directory.  As an example, we reuse the Libraries directory that was created to contain the libnabo sources.

```bash
cd ~/Libraries/
git clone git://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher.git
cd libpointmatcher
```

But, before compiling libpointmatcher, a `/build` directory must be created. Just like with libnabo, run the following commands :

```bash
SRC_DIR=${PWD}
BUILD_DIR=${SRC_DIR}/build
mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR} && cd ${BUILD_DIR}
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ${SRC_DIR}
```

Before moving on to the compilation and installation steps, here are some optional features that you can enable.

#### Compiling the documentation (optional)

Libpointmatcher is documented directly in the source-code using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html).  If Doxygen is installed on your system, an html version of the documentation will be compiled in `/usr/local/share/doc/libpointmatcher/`.  To install Doxygen on Ubuntu, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install doxygen
```

You will also need LaTeX for the equations rendering :

```bash
sudo apt-get install doxygen-latex
```

After you have installed Doxygen and LaTeX, you can enable the documentation by setting the CMake variable `GENERATE_API_DOC` to `TRUE`. This can be achieved through CMake-GUI or by the command line:

```bash
cmake -D GENERATE_API_DOC=TRUE ${SRC_DIR}
```

Compiling libpointmatcher will generate the documentation, which you can simply open the `/usr/local/share/doc/libpointmatcher/api/html/index.html` file to view the API documentation in a browser.

#### Compiling unit tests (optionnal)

If you want to verify that the version of libpointmatcher you have compiled is stable, you can enable them by setting the CMake variable `BUILD_TESTS` to `TRUE`. It can be done with CMake-GUI or via the command line:

```bash
cmake -D BUILD_TESTS=TRUE ${SRC_DIR}
```

Then, once the compilation process is completed, the unit tests can be run with the following command line:

```bash
utest/utest --path ${SRC_DIR}/examples/data/
```

#### Compilation

Now, to compile libpointmatcher into the `/build` directory, run the following command:

```bash
make -j N
```

*Note:* It is highly recommended to add the `-j N` optionnal argument to the `make` command in order to speed up the compilation process. Replace `N` by the number of parallel jobs you want to compile at the same time. 

#### Installation

Finally, to install libpointmatcher on your system, run the following command:

```bash
sudo make install
```

### 4. Possible Caveats

If Eigen, libnabo, yaml-cpp, or GTest are not found during the installation, you will have to manually supply their installation locations by setting the CMake flags. You can do so using the CMake-GUI.

```bash
cd build
cmake-gui .
```
![alt text](images/cmake_screenshot.png "Screenshot of CMake-GUI")
-->

<!---
If yaml-cpp was installed using apt-get as described above, it will not be found by the default CMake configuration.  You should set the `yaml-cpp_INCLUDE_DIRS` and `yaml-cpp_LIBRARIES` to `/usr/include/yaml-cpp` and `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/` respectively.  These locations could be different on your machine.  You can find them by the files installed by the libyaml package:

```bash
dpkg -L libyaml-cpp-dev
```
-->

<!---
You can then set `EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR`, `NABO_INCLUDE_DIR`, `NABO_LIBRARY`, `yaml-cpp_INCLUDE_DIRS`, `yaml-cpp_LIBRARIES` to point to your installation directories as shown in the screenshot above.  Then, generate the make files by clicking generate and rerun the following inside `/build`:

```bash
make
sudo make install
```
-->

# Having problems?
Some dependencies changed and we don't keep track of all combinations possible. Before reporting a problem, make sure to include the versions you are using. You can run the bash script `./utest/listVersionsUbuntu.sh` and copy-paste its output when [reporting an issue on github](https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/libpointmatcher/issues). You may need to ensure that the file is executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./utest/listVersionsUbuntu.sh
./utest/listVersionsUbuntu.sh
```


Here are the list of useful commands used in the bash script:

Ubuntu version:

```bash
lsb_release -r
```

32-bit or 64-bit architecture:

```bash
getconf LONG_BIT
```

Compiler version:

```bash
gcc --version
```

Git version:

```bash
git --version
```

CMake:

```bash
cmake --version
```

Boost version:

```bash
dpkg -s libboost-dev | grep Version
```

Eigen3:

```bash
dpkg -s libeigen3-dev | grep Version
```

Doxygen:

```bash
dpkg -s doxygen | grep Version
```
